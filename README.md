# Flutter Learning Journey

This repo is a collection of Flutter practice projects and experiments as I learn Flutter.
It includes basic widgets, stateful/stateless examples, simple apps like a ToDo list, calculator, and a fingertap game.
The goal is to build understanding gradually through hands-on coding.
